# A/B Test for An Improved Recommendation System for An International E-commerce ðŸ›’ðŸ†Ž

Have received an analytical task from an international online store. My predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.
